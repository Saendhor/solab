Answer 01:
You need to pass the address of a void * variable to pthread_join -- it
will get filled in with the exit value.
That void * then should be cast back to whatever type was originally stored
into it by the pthread_exit call:

# Sample code:

    for(j = 0 ; j < i ; ++j) {
        void *returnValue;
        pthread_join( tid[j], &returnValue);  /* BLOCK */
        printf("%zd\n",  (size_t)(off_t)returnValue);
    }

Answer 02:

# Sample code
    for(j = 0 ; j < i ; ++j) {
        int returnValue;
        pthread_join( tid[j], (void **)&returnValue);  /* BLOCK */
        printf("%d\n",  returnValue);
    }
